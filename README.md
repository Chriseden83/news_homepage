## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SaSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid / Subgrid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I enjoyed learning CSS grid and subgrid along with trying SCSS for the first time albeit the folder structure isn't what I'll be using for future projects. My HTML is changing the more I build projects as I'm understanding the structure to plan before I start to build. Adding the overlay was a challenge as it's not something I'd done before.

### Continued development

I need to become more proficient in javascript so my focus over the next few weeks will be vanilla JS. I'd like to understand accessability along with a CSS framework like Tailwind.
